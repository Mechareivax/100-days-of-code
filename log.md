# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0 September 19, 2018

I've decided to commit to doing - at the very least - an hour of coding every day to keep me productive and in touch with what I'm doing with myself each day. I continued my class on Udemy. I've been going back through lessons I've already done before since its been about two months since I last dove into the class. It was hard to focus today, but I was able to get through some of the videos. I'll attribute that to today being the first day of my week long video game cleanse. I'd like to just not play games at all for 7 days, but there's the temptation to play games after I've studied. But I can do other things instead. I can read a bit, cook a bit, watch a movie. I also think I'm just distracted by the desire to just make something already. I want to make a video game lorem ipsum generator. I feel like that'd require some knowledge on databases, which the next lesson gets to. And that's where I stopped last time. So here I go again. Just have to barrel through it.

**Worked on:** Classwork

**Feeling:** Scatterbrained, but determined
