# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0 September 19, 2018

I've decided to commit to doing - at the very least - an hour of coding every day to keep me productive and in touch with what I'm doing with myself each day. I continued my class on Udemy. I've been going back through lessons I've already done before since its been about two months since I last dove into the class. It was hard to focus today, but I was able to get through some of the videos. I'll attribute that to today being the first day of my week long video game cleanse. I'd like to just not play games at all for 7 days, but there's the temptation to play games after I've studied. But I can do other things instead. I can read a bit, cook a bit, watch a movie. I also think I'm just distracted by the desire to just make something already. I want to make a video game lorem ipsum generator. I feel like that'd require some knowledge on databases, which the next lesson gets to. And that's where I stopped last time. So here I go again. Just have to barrel through it.

**Worked on:** Classwork

**Feeling:** Scatterbrained, but determined


### Day 1 September 20, 2018

Worked at my day job from 11am to 9pm, and then went to grab food, so I ended up getting home and sitting down at around 11pm. Even so, I was able to work on some FreeCodeCamp stuff from about 11:20pm to 12:50am. Not straight through, but more focused than I thought I'd be considering I'm all the way exhausted from work. Now to bed so I can serve more tomorrow. Hopefully not for too much longer!

**Worked on:** FCC exercises

**Feeling:** Tired


### Day 2 September 21, 2018

Completed another hour of classwork and jumped onto FCC to get through a few challenges. Is that what they're called? I don't remember. This is before work, so I feel like I did something I want and need to do before I'm about to spend my night doing something that I desparately don't want, but unfortunately need to do. Looking forward to learning databases. I feel like that's gonna be a big milestone.

**Worked on:** Classwork and FCC exercises

**Feeling:** Accomplished


### Day 3 September 22, 2018

Did some FCC exercises and finally got to the point where they have you do actual projects! I was able to finish the tribute page and the survey form. I want to go back to the survey so I can style it better. Maybe mess with some grid stuff to make it more appealing. I ended up coding from about 11:15am to 2:50pm today so that's neat. And the only reason I'm not diving into the next project is because of work. It seems like it's all front end stuff which is fine since I'm still getting used to back end and even JS. I feel really productive, but also super bummed that I have to stop to go work. I really enjoy doing this.

**Feeling:** Productive


### Day 4 September 24, 2018

It's Monday, which means I had a thirteen hour work day yesterday, got home, and went directly to bed. There was a zero percent chance of me doing any work yesterday night. Exhaustion had become me. But today I worked on styling the survey form from yesterday and learned some things. Such as the fact that a ul puts padding on itself automatically and it has the potential to make things look gross. And for perservering for five days, I've rewarded myself with wine. Huzzah!

**Feeling:** Like, so refreshed
