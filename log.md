# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0 September 19, 2018

I've decided to commit to doing - at the very least - an hour of coding every day to keep me productive and in touch with what I'm doing with myself each day. I continued my class on Udemy. I've been going back through lessons I've already done before since its been about two months since I last dove into the class. It was hard to focus today, but I was able to get through some of the videos. I'll attribute that to today being the first day of my week long video game cleanse. I'd like to just not play games at all for 7 days, but there's the temptation to play games after I've studied. But I can do other things instead. I can read a bit, cook a bit, watch a movie. I also think I'm just distracted by the desire to just make something already. I want to make a video game lorem ipsum generator. I feel like that'd require some knowledge on databases, which the next lesson gets to. And that's where I stopped last time. So here I go again. Just have to barrel through it.

**Worked on:** Classwork

**Feeling:** Scatterbrained, but determined


### Day 1 September 20, 2018

Worked at my day job from 11am to 9pm, and then went to grab food, so I ended up getting home and sitting down at around 11pm. Even so, I was able to work on some FreeCodeCamp stuff from about 11:20pm to 12:50am. Not straight through, but more focused than I thought I'd be considering I'm all the way exhausted from work. Now to bed so I can serve more tomorrow. Hopefully not for too much longer!

**Worked on:** FCC exercises

**Feeling:** Tired


### Day 2 September 21, 2018

Completed another hour of classwork and jumped onto FCC to get through a few challenges. Is that what they're called? I don't remember. This is before work, so I feel like I did something I want and need to do before I'm about to spend my night doing something that I desparately don't want, but unfortunately need to do. Looking forward to learning databases. I feel like that's gonna be a big milestone.

**Worked on:** Classwork and FCC exercises

**Feeling:** Accomplished


### Day 3 September 22, 2018

Did some FCC exercises and finally got to the point where they have you do actual projects! I was able to finish the tribute page and the survey form. I want to go back to the survey so I can style it better. Maybe mess with some grid stuff to make it more appealing. I ended up coding from about 11:15am to 2:50pm today so that's neat. And the only reason I'm not diving into the next project is because of work. It seems like it's all front end stuff which is fine since I'm still getting used to back end and even JS. I feel really productive, but also super bummed that I have to stop to go work. I really enjoy doing this.

**Feeling:** Productive


### Day 4 September 24, 2018

It's Monday, which means I had a thirteen hour work day yesterday, got home, and went directly to bed. There was a zero percent chance of me doing any work yesterday night. Exhaustion had become me. But today I worked on styling the survey form from yesterday and learned some things. Such as the fact that a ul puts padding on itself automatically and it has the potential to make things look gross. And for perservering for five days, I've rewarded myself with wine. Huzzah!

**Feeling:** Like, so refreshed


### Day 5 September 25, 2018

Another hour down, and with this I was able to fully finish my video game survey form! I might go back and add some extra questions for fun, but for now I'm closing the book on that. It's minimalistic and that's okay. But that submit button is looking reaaal good. I learned about linear gradients and the button:active selector. Which both of those things seem like they'd be fairly useful in the long run. I used my whiteboard to help figure out what divs I wanted where and wrapping what items, and that proved to be really useful. It's super helpful to be able to step by step go through a problem in a visual manner. I'm absolutely going to be keeping this whiteboard by my desk. I'm also debating finishing my video game cleanse today. This is the sixth day of no games and it hasn't actually been all too hard. It helps that I've been busy with friends, the hour a day, and stuff like that, so my mind hasn't been solely occupied by my lack of games. Honestly I wouldn't even know what I would play. I'll figure it out.

**Feeling:** Really good


### Day 6 September 26, 2018

Wow, I spent so long on this today. I started on the landing page for a product after having a lot of issues deciding on what the product would be. I was talking about it with my partner when we thought of doing a sevice that presses your favorite episodes of a podcast to vinyl. The most hipster thing imaginable. I worked on it for a little over four hours which, part-way through the power went out and I forgot to save, so I had to start again from pretty far back. So that's a lesson learned in the hardest way possible. But I went back in and rebuilt what had been lost. I learned about parallax scrolling on images, box and text shadows, that h1's also have weird default stylings that need to be overwritten, and how to build a navbar from scratch. A whole lot. This has been a week! First week of many.

**Feeling:** Awesome


### Day 7 September 27, 2018

I took a break from my double shift today to grab my laptop from home and do some work. I was able to do some good stuff too. I figured out the centering business on the email field. Turns out flexbox is super useful in centering things like that. I set the flex-direction to coulumn, so things would be top to bottom, then align-items and justify-content to center. Together, they give me the exact effect I'm looking for, where everything is centered on a vertical line, and only take up as much space as they need. Okay, back to serving.

**Feeling:** Like I'm making actual progress


### Day 8 September 28, 2018

I worked some more on the prooduct landing page and I'm declaring it finished for now. I threw in a media query to make it so that the 3 links to the right just disappear when browsing on mobile, added two more videos to the example section, and styled the submit button and the email input. Then I started and finished to technical doocumentation page project. That didn't take too long. I decided that, that project was more about displaying information and being able to access it quickly, than it was about styling and making something appealing to a consumer. So I didn't do much styling on it at all. Besides, it didn't really introduce anything new other than the code tag. I looked at a bunch of different porfolio websites so some ideas on what to do with mine for the last front end project. That, I'm excited about it. It's not going to be this ground breaking design masterpiece, but I'd like for it to have some animations here and there and a good balance of information and aesthetics.

**Feeling:** Good


### Day 9 September 29, 2018

I worked a long night at work and was still able to come home and positively say that I could do some coding before bed. That's pretty great, I think. I started work on version 1 of my portfolio website. I imagine I'd probably do some revisions as I improve and get more practice with things like Javascript. I did get to mess with some animations and thats was neat. Very basic stuff, nothing too huge. But now I have some fancy fade ins for the site. So that's neat. I've got to go back to work in 8 hours so I'm going to bed now. I'm writing this one on my phone right before bed so this was a short one.

**Worked on:** Portfolio site V1 (currently in local storage)

**Feeling:** Satisfied and sleepy


### Day 10 September 30, 2018

Wow, cool, made it to day 10. It really hasn't been too hard either. It's really easy to say that I'm just going to spend an hour coding and just do it. It's even easier to spend more than just an hour coding. I need to get better at pre-planning, though. I spend a lot of time changing what I want a site to look like mid way. I'm also currently struggling with keeping to one task within a project. I get caught up on aesthetics a lot of the time and end up trying to get something else to work and look good. I'll get there though.

**Worked on:** Portfolio site V1 (currently in local storage)

**Feeling:** Like I hit a milestone


### Day 11 October 1, 2018

It's coming up on the spookiest time of the year. To celebrate, I did a whole lot of a lot of different things today. I put a pin in my portfolio website for now because I don't want to pigeonhole myself into a website that could be so much more but isn't because I insisted on not learning more technologies before I committed to it. I wanna learn more about EJS and JS in general so I can have some fun interactivity in the portfolio. Optional fun of course. Not like, finish this game in order to see information on this person who is trying to get a job with you. I installed node onto my desktop and fiddled around with the command line of this machine. I've done some command line stuff in c9 before but not on a local machine before, so that was cool. I'll probably end up looking more into setting up a local development environment tomorrow. I also started on the JS portion of the FCC coursework. Hopefullly I can get through some more of that tomorrow as well.

**Worked on:** A few different, little things

**Feeling:** Productive
