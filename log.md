# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0 September 19, 2018

I've decided to commit to doing - at the very least - an hour of coding every day to keep me productive and in touch with what I'm doing with myself each day. I continued my class on Udemy. I've been going back through lessons I've already done before since its been about two months since I last dove into the class. It was hard to focus today, but I was able to get through some of the videos. I'll attribute that to today being the first day of my week long video game cleanse. I'd like to just not play games at all for 7 days, but there's the temptation to play games after I've studied. But I can do other things instead. I can read a bit, cook a bit, watch a movie. I also think I'm just distracted by the desire to just make something already. I want to make a video game lorem ipsum generator. I feel like that'd require some knowledge on databases, which the next lesson gets to. And that's where I stopped last time. So here I go again. Just have to barrel through it.

**Worked on:** Classwork

**Feeling:** Scatterbrained, but determined


### Day 1 September 20, 2018

Worked at my day job from 11am to 9pm, and then went to grab food, so I ended up getting home and sitting down at around 11pm. Even so, I was able to work on some FreeCodeCamp stuff from about 11:20pm to 12:50am. Not straight through, but more focused than I thought I'd be considering I'm all the way exhausted from work. Now to bed so I can serve more tomorrow. Hopefully not for too much longer!

**Worked on:** FCC exercises

**Feeling:** Tired


### Day 2 September 21, 2018

Completed another hour of classwork and jumped onto FCC to get through a few challenges. Is that what they're called? I don't remember. This is before work, so I feel like I did something I want and need to do before I'm about to spend my night doing something that I desparately don't want, but unfortunately need to do. Looking forward to learning databases. I feel like that's gonna be a big milestone.

**Worked on:** Classwork and FCC exercises

**Feeling:** Accomplished


### Day 3 September 22, 2018

Did some FCC exercises and finally got to the point where they have you do actual projects! I was able to finish the tribute page and the survey form. I want to go back to the survey so I can style it better. Maybe mess with some grid stuff to make it more appealing. I ended up coding from about 11:15am to 2:50pm today so that's neat. And the only reason I'm not diving into the next project is because of work. It seems like it's all front end stuff which is fine since I'm still getting used to back end and even JS. I feel really productive, but also super bummed that I have to stop to go work. I really enjoy doing this.

**Worked on:** https://codepen.io/xmedr10/pen/gdywYv https://codepen.io/xmedr10/pen/YOMGgO

**Feeling:** Productive


### Day 4 September 24, 2018

It's Monday, which means I had a thirteen hour work day yesterday, got home, and went directly to bed. There was a zero percent chance of me doing any work yesterday night. Exhaustion had become me. But today I worked on styling the survey form from yesterday and learned some things. Such as the fact that a ul puts padding on itself automatically and it has the potential to make things look gross. And for perservering for five days, I've rewarded myself with wine. Huzzah!

**Worked on:** https://codepen.io/xmedr10/pen/YOMGgO

**Feeling:** Like, so refreshed


### Day 5 September 25, 2018

Another hour down, and with this I was able to fully finish my video game survey form! I might go back and add some extra questions for fun, but for now I'm closing the book on that. It's minimalistic and that's okay. But that submit button is looking reaaal good. I learned about linear gradients and the button:active selector. Which both of those things seem like they'd be fairly useful in the long run. I used my whiteboard to help figure out what divs I wanted where and wrapping what items, and that proved to be really useful. It's super helpful to be able to step by step go through a problem in a visual manner. I'm absolutely going to be keeping this whiteboard by my desk. I'm also debating finishing my video game cleanse today. This is the sixth day of no games and it hasn't actually been all too hard. It helps that I've been busy with friends, the hour a day, and stuff like that, so my mind hasn't been solely occupied by my lack of games. Honestly I wouldn't even know what I would play. I'll figure it out.

**Worked on:** https://codepen.io/xmedr10/full/YOMGgO/

**Feeling:** Really good


### Day 6 September 26, 2018

Wow, I spent so long on this today. I started on the landing page for a product after having a lot of issues deciding on what the product would be. I was talking about it with my partner when we thought of doing a sevice that presses your favorite episodes of a podcast to vinyl. The most hipster thing imaginable. I worked on it for a little over four hours which, part-way through the power went out and I forgot to save, so I had to start again from pretty far back. So that's a lesson learned in the hardest way possible. But I went back in and rebuilt what had been lost. I learned about parallax scrolling on images, box and text shadows, that h1's also have weird default stylings that need to be overwritten, and how to build a navbar from scratch. A whole lot. This has been a week! First week of many.

**Worked on:** https://codepen.io/xmedr10/full/dqxerp/

**Feeling:** Awesome


### Day 7 September 27, 2018

I took a break from my double shift today to grab my laptop from home and do some work. I was able to do some good stuff too. I figured out the centering business on the email field. Turns out flexbox is super useful in centering things like that. I set the flex-direction to coulumn, so things would be top to bottom, then align-items and justify-content to center. Together, they give me the exact effect I'm looking for, where everything is centered on a vertical line, and only take up as much space as they need. Okay, back to serving.

**Worked on:** https://codepen.io/xmedr10/full/dqxerp/

**Feeling:** Like I'm making actual progress


### Day 8 September 28, 2018

I worked some more on the prooduct landing page and I'm declaring it finished for now. I threw in a media query to make it so that the 3 links to the right just disappear when browsing on mobile, added two more videos to the example section, and styled the submit button and the email input. Then I started and finished to technical doocumentation page project. That didn't take too long. I decided that, that project was more about displaying information and being able to access it quickly, than it was about styling and making something appealing to a consumer. So I didn't do much styling on it at all. Besides, it didn't really introduce anything new other than the code tag. I looked at a bunch of different porfolio websites so some ideas on what to do with mine for the last front end project. That, I'm excited about it. It's not going to be this ground breaking design masterpiece, but I'd like for it to have some animations here and there and a good balance of information and aesthetics.

**Worked on:** https://codepen.io/xmedr10/pen/vVYMaY https://codepen.io/xmedr10/full/dqxerp/

**Feeling:** Good


### Day 9 September 29, 2018

I worked a long night at work and was still able to come home and positively say that I could do some coding before bed. That's pretty great, I think. I started work on version 1 of my portfolio website. I imagine I'd probably do some revisions as I improve and get more practice with things like Javascript. I did get to mess with some animations and thats was neat. Very basic stuff, nothing too huge. But now I have some fancy fade ins for the site. So that's neat. I've got to go back to work in 8 hours so I'm going to bed now. I'm writing this one on my phone right before bed so this was a short one.

**Worked on:** Portfolio site V1 (currently in local storage)

**Feeling:** Satisfied and sleepy


### Day 10 September 30, 2018

Wow, cool, made it to day 10. It really hasn't been too hard either. It's really easy to say that I'm just going to spend an hour coding and just do it. It's even easier to spend more than just an hour coding. I need to get better at pre-planning, though. I spend a lot of time changing what I want a site to look like mid way. I'm also currently struggling with keeping to one task within a project. I get caught up on aesthetics a lot of the time and end up trying to get something else to work and look good. I'll get there though.

**Worked on:** Portfolio site V1 (currently in local storage)

**Feeling:** Like I hit a milestone


### Day 11 October 1, 2018

It's coming up on the spookiest time of the year. To celebrate, I did a whole lot of a lot of different things today. I put a pin in my portfolio website for now because I don't want to pigeonhole myself into a website that could be so much more but isn't because I insisted on not learning more technologies before I committed to it. I wanna learn more about EJS and JS in general so I can have some fun interactivity in the portfolio. Optional fun of course. Not like, finish this game in order to see information on this person who is trying to get a job with you. I installed node onto my desktop and fiddled around with the command line of this machine. I've done some command line stuff in c9 before but not on a local machine before, so that was cool. I'll probably end up looking more into setting up a local development environment tomorrow. I also started on the JS portion of the FCC coursework. Hopefullly I can get through some more of that tomorrow as well.

**Worked on:** A few different, little things

**Feeling:** Productive


### Day 12 October 2, 2018

Did some more of the JS stuff on FCC. I'm about to learn about switch statements which I actually don't know if I've ever heard of. So that'll be interesting. I forget that I definitely like aesthetics more than logic. The JS stuff always stumps me in weird ways. But I've gotten through stuff with JS before and I can do it again.

**Worked on:** FCC coursework

**Feeling:** Distracted by the events of the day


### Day 13 October 17, 2018

Took some time off, definitely not on purpose, but because Javascript always does that to me while I'm learning it. I get frustrated and don't come back to learning for a while. It definitely happened today. I was trying to figure out an exercise on FCC and got frustrated with myself along the way and now I'm just a little too riled up to continue for the day. This is the learning process though and I really shouldn't beat myself up about things like this. I read a post on reddit that said something to the effect of "you're trying to learn programming AND problem solving, two things that are different from each other and to you". It helped bring me back up. I do enjoy the FCC stuff but I don't think it's very good at teaching you problem solving. It's fine at showing you how a piece of code works (along with other supplementary resources) but isn't great at showing how to actually solve problems with it. But also, I need to learn to stick with the exercises and learn with an open mind instead of putting myself down. I'll come back to this one tomorrow.

**Worked on:** FCC coursework

**Feeling:** Not so great, but aware


### Day 14 October 18, 2018

Some more Javascript. I still don't entirely understand the solution that the site had for that last project, but I'm rolling with it for now. I finished all of the basic Javascript exercises and I'll be onto ES6 tomorrow. What does it for me on JS is the logic. It's something I actually need to practice, whereas with html and css it's all googling and finding out the rules of a property. JS is straight up problem solving through math and that's something I haven't done much of. I really will need to just hammer out some projects to get myself used to that.

**Worked on:** FCC Coursework

**Feeling:** Way better


### Day 15 October 19, 2018

I got to an exercise that was really foreign and had me using and researching things that the course hadn't actually covered yet. Thankfully I was able to find a post where other people were having the same problems that I was with that specific exercise. It was cool to be able to learn about chainging arrow functions, but I really do think that, that should have been something covered in a later section. I'm over here barely understanding the difference in scope between let and var, and the program suddenly asks me not only to figure out what map() and filter() do and how they work, but to also figure out how to chain those things together in arrow functions. I also looked at some more jobs in Indeed just to see what people want for a junior front end dev, and researched what TypeScript, Angular, and React actually are. I've read them referenced on a lot of different things, and now I finally have some familiarity with what they do. I also did some research on effective problem solving. So that's cool.

**Worked on:** FCC Coursework

**Feeling:** Pretty good


### Day 16 October 20, 2018

I worked 11 hours today (could have been 13, but a coworker did me a huge favor) and then came home and did some coursework. I'm really starting to see the flaws in the FCC stuff. They're kinda throwing stuff at you as a side thought and expecting you to know how things that haven't been discussed work in order to solve a problem. And then the tests themselves aren't always directly related to the examples given. It's something to keep an eye out for. I researched the spread and rest operators for arrays, and destructuring objects. I definitely am going to need to read up on both of those things a whole lot more because I'm not comfortable with them in the slightest right this moment. I'm glad that I am learning about these things though. And even if I don't understand these things now, when I do really need to apply them I can at least say that I've seen these things before. I need to get back into DOM manipulation so that I can continue actually making things. I can't wait.

**Worked on:** FCC Coursework

**Feeling:** Exhausted, but alright


### Day 17 October 23, 2018

Did some more ES6 studying. Learned about classes and constructors, as well as getters and setters. I assume this is going to be the start of some object oriented programming lessons. I've realized that while I'm studying javascript and logic based stuff, I can't expect to rely solely on FCC's explanations on things to complete their exercises. Because of that, I've found some decent teachers on Youtube who come across as both passionate and clear when it comes to explaining logic. I finished off the studying by looking at some regular expression matching and searching which seems like it'll be simple enough.

**Worked on:** Studying ES6

**Feeling:** Like I'm making progress

### Day 18 November 19, 2018

I have two overarching thoughts for this one. First, is that I went on vacation to Portland, OR and I'm now planning on moving there, hence the absence. Second, is regular expressions are the devil. I worked through all of those exercises and needed a good bit of extracurricular reading for everyone of them. That was one of those moments where I really wished I was in school and had access to a professor who could sit down and explain why things do and do not work. Since going to Portland I've decided that, living there is something that I definitely want and that is now what is driving me to study and practice more. It'd be nice to be able to comfortably afford to live there. I'm also extremely happy that I now have a motivation that is a good thing as opposed to a negative thing. Before, my motivation was simply to get out of the restaurant industry and work with something I actually enjoy. Now, that still remains but it's helped by the fact that I immensely want to live in Portland. I loved everything there. The food was phenomenal, the people were delightful, the scenery was breathtaking, and my interests were alive there. I went to a video game bar that was unlike any I'd experienced before and was so happy, I almost cried. The thought of having a community of people in closer proximity that actually like the things I do is amazing. Absolutely amazing. So that means coding day in, day out.

**Worked on:** FCC Couursework

**Feeling:** Amazing

### Day 19 November 20, 2018

I spent, literally the whole day on practicing making algorithms in Javascript. My brain is tired. I am tired. I would have finished sooner if life hadn't gotten in the way. But even so, the unit is done. I'm not particularly proud of how I went about it - I most certainly should have stopped and continued tomorrow - but today my stubborness to finish the unit won. I need to get better at learning which built in methods work on which data types. I kept trying to use split on an array and splice on strings. Even now, I'm not entirely sure if those are right haha. But tomorrow will be another day and my brain will have reset. And tonight, I dream of logic.

**Worked on:** Making algorithms woo

**Feeling:** Burnt out for the day

### Day 20 November 21, 2018

Tis the day ere Thanksgiving. Got a long couple days ahead, what with visiting family. But I was still able to finish an hour of learning today. I'm starting to learn about Object Oriented Programming which I believe is huge, because this is how games are made. It also seems like it in general is a widely used method of programming and problem solving which I can absolutely get behind. I bookmarked a couple things to read while I'm over at my parents'. Some stuff about using OOP to make a simple platformer and some sort of self-proclaimed "Front End Master Handbook". It sounded ominous so I'm super into it.

**Worked on:** Learning OOP

**Feeling:** Great

### Day 21 November 22, 2018

I'm writing this from my parents' house on Thanksgiving, so that's cool. I was able to set aside time for my hour despite my family being the way that my family is! I looked at some Python stuff today, installed it, and wrote a hello world program to make sure it works. I might keep reading about python today if I end up getting bored during the festivities. I also continued to learn about Object Oriented Programming which I'm super excited about, but if I see the word prototype again I'm going to turn off my computer haha.

**Worked on:** Learning OOP

**Feeling:** Productive

### Day 22 November 23, 2018

I started studying a little later in the day than I would have liked but I was still able to get it done. Pretty jazzed about that. I finished the section on object oriented programming and started the section on functional programming. I don't have much experience with this as a concept so I'm excited to see how this goes. At least with object oriented I had tinkered around with Unity and, you know, have used objects that had their own abstract properties in the real world. I suppose functional won't be too difficult. It's got some pretty solid principles that seem to make sense and be efficient. I also looked into buying a web domain today since it is black friday, which is apparently the best day of the year to buy one. I really played with the idea for a while, especially since it was relatively cheap and I could have a .moe site which is all I want in this life. I ended up not going for it since money is fairly tight for me right now. If I was getting some income from web dev right now, I would probably be able to justify buying a domain and just dip into the funds earned from that, but I don't so I won't. It's feeling close though. Hopefully after the Javascript segment I can hatch some project ideas and work on that for a while. The only ideas I have for right this moment are the video game lorem ipsum - which seems to require knowledge of databases - and my own portfolio site - which I still need to sit down and actually design.

**Working on:** FCC Coursework

**Feeling:** Sleepy, but good

### Day 23 November 25, 2018

Yesterday was a 12 hour work day, so when I got home I just went directly to bed. I've got work later today but I managed to continue on with learning about functional programming. It's much more understandable than I thought it was going to be, which I'm super happy about. I learned a bit about map and filter and made my own versions of those methods. I'm also looking into buying some programming related reading material since so many things are on sale this weekend. I think it'd be immensely helpful to have something tangible I could read offline and away from a screen.

**Worked on:** FCC coursework

**Feeling:** Productive

### Day 24 November 26, 2018

Worked for a few hours today and watched an interview that the guy from Fun Fun Function had with Brazlian programmer Isa Silveira. I finished the section on functional programming and I'm super relieved. It went pretty well aside from one project that I was able to figure out on my own using a different approach than the example and solution had, but then when I tried to use the provided solution to try to understand why it worked, it simply didn't. I spent a while trying to figure out why and I still cannot understand if their solution is even supposed to work or if there's a typo or something. I straight up copied and pasted the answer after a little bit and it still didn't pass the tests haha. But I realized that I was spending maybe a little too much time on that and moved on. I also dipped my toes into currying. I understand it as a concept and how it works, but I'm still just a little fuzzy on practical applications of currying. I understand that it exists to make code modular and if you don't have all the arguments available you can still start to pre-cook your code, I think I just need to see it in action to know when to use it. Then I watched that interview and their topics were really interesting. The reason I went into it was to listen to accomplished people talk about accepting and needing failure in their projects and for growth, but I ended up learning about so much more. They spoke about heuristics as opposed to hypotheses, the state of Rio's commercial technology, and how having an enormous fuck up can numb you to the fear of any subsequent fuck ups. That last point boils down to basically, that feeling of "okay something very bad happened, and I survived". It was really informative to watch.

**Worked on:** Learning to learn, it felt like

**Feeling:** Optimistic

### Day 25 November 27, 2018

Did a couple hours worth of creating three algorithms. When it's written out like that, it makes it seem like I took a hell of a lot longer than I was supposed to on those exercises haha. I was able to do all of them on my own though, so that's cool. The problem came when I started working on the fourth exercise and it shifted from working with arrays to an array of objects with properties. I'd spent the last couple days thinking about things only in terms of arrays, so all of my knowledge of objects are buried under all this recent stuff. I'm calling it for myself today on those problems. I'll come back to them either tonight or tomorrow. It's like having played Monster Hunter for a month and then playing Dark Souls. Similar enough problems to solve but you have to reacclimate yourself to a new toolset and a new control scheme. I straight up can't think of objects as not arrays right now. I want to solve the problem by iterating through each object and displaying every property as an array and then making them objects again. Which I'm sure that is one way to do it, but I'd rather solve the problem as if it was an object, not turn it into an array. I think I just need some time away from the problem for now. Give myself a chance to reset my thinking. I do think I'm getting better at problem solving. I felt like before it was a lot of me throwing things at a wall and seeing what sticks. Now I'm better at isolating parts of a problem and seeing what is and isn't working, and then going from there. Writing things down and working through them that way really help as well.

**Worked on:** Making algorithms

**Feeling:** Stumped, but aware

### Day 26 November 28, 2018

So I finished the exercise from yesterday with some help. Afterwards, I decided I'd just try to set up a database for the project I've been wanting to do for a long time now, which is a lorem ipsum generator that spits out video game and anime things quotes and words. That led me down a rabbit hole of how to get a local server running, which led me down a rabbit hole of how to connect a local repository to a remote one on github through the command line. And that was literally my morning. I wrote an h1 on the index file and set the background to red on the css file. It's not an amazing start, but now the files exist and I know how to push them onto a public setting. That accounts for something. I learned some of git today so I'd say that was a success. And now I have the way paved for future commits.

**Worked on:** Learning git, setting up a test server

**Feeling:** Fine

### Day 27 December 3, 2018

I finally started work on that lorem ipsum generator I've wanted to do for a while. I spent about an hour working on the design, so it isn't the most groundbreaking design in the world. I did look at some other generators to see how they format their stuff, and what features I wanted to include in my own generator. So I'm assuming the look of the site will change over time, but for now I'm content. In terms of actual lines of code written, there wasn't a lot. Between designing and figuring out how to include local fonts, I spent a lot of time so I got all the html elements I wanted onto the page. Next time I work on it will be styling.

**Worked on:** WASDipsum

**Feeling:** Good

### Day 28 December 4, 2018

Today was a light day. I worked some more on learning git. I committed all of my files to the github repo and then cloned it onto my laptop so I can work on it from either machine. Felt good to manage to understand git enough to do something productive with it, something that's done in the real world.

**Worked on:** Git

**Feeling:** Productive

### Day 29 March 19, 2019

What an intermission! An absurd amount of time has passed since I last committed myself to coding a bit a day, which means a whole lot of stuff happened in life. December was extremely hectic, being a server in a Christmas town. January was a bit of a downer in terms of income and emotion. Something happened in February which was probably among the worst thing to ever happen in my life. And now we're in the middle of March and I'm back at my web dev shenanigans. I'm approaching this without the mentality of starting over, hence picking this up where I left off. And for now, tutorials are going to take a back seat while I focus on creating actual websites. I'm fairly confident in my ability to at least do the html and css portion of web dev, so I'll slowly introduce dynamic elements while learning on my own. Today I got a good deal of the work done for WASDipsum and I'll be putting some of that up on Instagram and Twitter to maybe - MAYBE- start finding a community. I'm excited!

**Worked on:** WASDipsum

**Feeling:** Recommitted

### Day 30 March 20, 2019

I actually did it. I finished styling a web page for a personal project. I'm absurdly proud of the work I've put into it and what I've learned from this. I also decided that I want to get absolutely insane at CSS. There's so much power in design and I'd love to be able to really capitalize on bringing my own visual ideas into projects. Wow. I finished a page for a personal project. Once it gets the functionality that it needs I'll be over the moon. I still need to do a few things like make the result page for where the lorem ipsum gets dumped. Or maybe I should even just put it on the same page. I haven't thought that far ahead.

**Worked onL** WASDipsum

**Feeling:** almost "over the moon"
